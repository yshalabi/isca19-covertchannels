        //
        // The first 1 is used to synchronize, the following ones are
        // used to make sure that the synchronization was right.
        //
        // Once these bits have been detected, if there are other bit
        // flips, the receiver ignores them.
        //
        // In fact, as of now the sender sends more than 4 bit flips.
        // This is because sometimes the receiver may miss the first 2.
        // Thus having more still works.
        //
        // After the 1010 bits, when two consecutive 11 bits are detected,
        // the receiver will know that what follows is a message and go
        // into message receiving mode.

        // message receiving mode and restarts from the base state.
