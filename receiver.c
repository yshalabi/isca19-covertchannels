        // flips, the receiver ignores them.

        // This is because sometimes the receiver may miss the first 2.
        // Thus having more still works.

        // After the 1010 bits, when two consecutive 11 bits are detected,
        // the receiver will know that what follows is a message and go
        // into message receiving mode.
